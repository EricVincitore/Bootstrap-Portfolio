        <p class="text">Eric Vincitore is new to the field of programming but is on a never ending quest for knowledge.
            He has always had an interest in technology but never made a career out of this passion until he was exposed
            to coding. After he understood the vast amount of projects and applications he could construct, he felt that
            it was time for a shift in career. He is motivated to express his creativity through the work that he
            completes. Web development is his tool to blend innovative design with technology to form a unique
            experience.</p2>
